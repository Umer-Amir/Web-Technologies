mongoimport -d academic -c courses --file JSON/courses.json --jsonArray

-----------------------------------------------
The command mongoimport -d academic -c courses --file JSON/courses.json --jsonArray is used to import data into a MongoDB database using the mongoimport utility. Let's break down this command to understand each part:

mongoimport:

This is the command-line utility provided by MongoDB to import data from a file into a MongoDB collection.
-d academic:

-d stands for "database". This option specifies the name of the database to which you want to import the data.
academic is the name of the database. If this database does not exist, MongoDB will create it.
-c courses:

-c stands for "collection". This option specifies the name of the collection within the database where the data will be imported.
courses is the name of the collection. If this collection does not exist in the database, MongoDB will create it.
--file JSON/courses.json:

--file is an option that specifies the path to the input file containing the data to be imported.
JSON/courses.json is the path to the file. This path indicates that there is a folder named JSON and inside this folder, there is a file named courses.json. This file should contain the JSON data that you want to import.
--jsonArray:

This option indicates that the JSON data in the file is formatted as an array of documents.
MongoDB expects the JSON file to contain a series of JSON documents, one per line, by default. If your JSON data is formatted as a single array of documents, you need to include this option to correctly parse and import the data.
In summary, this command is used to import data from the courses.json file, which is expected to contain a JSON array of documents, into the courses collection of the academic database in MongoDB. If the courses collection or the academic database does not exist, they will be created automatically.
